# Neiboro Setup Summary

## ✅ **What We've Accomplished**

### **1. Database Schema & Architecture**
- **Complete Supabase schema** (`supabase/schema.sql`)
  - Users table with Clerk integration
  - Posts table for help offers/requests
  - Post responses for community interaction
  - Neighborhoods for location-based grouping
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
  - Proper indexes and triggers

### **2. Authentication & User Management**
- **Clerk webhook integration** (`/api/webhook/clerk`)
  - Automatic user sync between Clerk and Supabase
  - Handles user creation, updates, and deletion
  - Secure webhook verification with svix
- **UserService** (`lib/user-service.ts`)
  - Complete CRUD operations
  - Clerk ID lookups and management
  - Proper TypeScript typing

### **3. Post Management System**
- **PostService** (`lib/post-service.ts`)
  - Create, read, update, delete posts
  - Filter by type (offer/request)
  - Location-based filtering by postcode
  - User-specific post management
- **Posts API** (`/api/posts`)
  - RESTful endpoints for post operations
  - Authentication-protected creation
  - Query parameters for filtering

### **4. Type Safety & Code Organization**
- **Centralized types** (`lib/types.ts`)
  - Database interfaces (User, Post, PostResponse, etc.)
  - API types (Address, Webhook events)
  - Proper separation of concerns
- **Supabase client** (`lib/supabase.ts`)
  - Client and admin configurations
  - Environment-based setup

### **5. Development Tools**
- **Setup script** (`setup.sh`)
  - Automated dependency installation
  - Environment template creation
  - Setup guidance
- **Health check API** (`/api/health`)
  - Database connection testing
  - Service validation
- **Comprehensive README**
  - Setup instructions
  - Architecture documentation
  - Development guidelines

### **6. Package Dependencies**
- Added `@supabase/supabase-js` for database operations
- Added `svix` for secure webhook handling
- Updated package.json with proper versions

## **🔧 Next Steps for You**

### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **2. Update Environment Variables**
You need to replace the placeholder in `.env.local`:
```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key_here
```
Get this from your Supabase project settings → API → service_role key.

### **3. Run Database Schema**
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
4. Run the query to create all tables and policies

### **4. Set Up Clerk Webhook**
1. In Clerk Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Create new endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook/clerk`
3. Select events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
4. The webhook secret is already in your `.env.local`

### **5. Test the Setup**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then visit:
- `http://localhost:3000` - Main app
- `http://localhost:3000/api/health` - Database connection test
