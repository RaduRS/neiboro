General User Rules for AI Code Generation
These are my personal rules for all code generation. The AI must follow these rules in all projects and interactions.

Follow Core Principles: Always write code that adheres to:

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Abstract any repeated logic into reusable functions or components.

Separation of Concerns: Keep UI, state, and API logic clearly separated.

Automate Code Quality: Always fix any linting or formatting errors yourself. The final code you provide must be clean and pass all linter checks.

Responsive Design First: All UI components and layouts must be fully responsive. They must look great and function perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

No Server Commands: Never attempt to run development or preview servers. Your role is to write and modify code files only. Do not execute commands like npm run dev, or npm run preview.
