Project: Neiboro
Website: neiboro.co.uk

Core Concept
Neoboro is a hyper-local, private mutual aid platform designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA). It connects a specific "neighborhood cluster" (e.g., 2-4 streets), serving as a digital bulletin board where neighbors can post "Offers" of help and "Requests" for assistance.

The core mission is to foster a high-trust community of solidarity and direct support by providing a simple, secure, and exclusive space for neighbors to connect.

Technology Stack
The platform is built on a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack:

Framework: Next.js – For a fast, server-rendered React application.

UI Components: shadcn/ui – For a set of beautifully designed, accessible, and composable components built on top of Tailwind CSS.

Authentication: Clerk – To handle user sign-up, sign-in, and profile management with pre-built, secure UI components.

Backend & Database: Supabase – For the PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions (powering the live bulletin board), and user data storage.

Key Features
Progressive Web App (PWA): Installable on any device (iOS, Android, desktop) with an icon on the home screen for an app-like experience.

Real-Time Bulletin Board: A live feed of offers and requests that updates automatically without needing a page refresh.

Push Notifications: To alert users to new activity and keep the community engaged.

Neighborhood Cluster Exclusivity: User registration is verified by address to ensure the platform remains a private and trusted space for a specific neighborhood.
